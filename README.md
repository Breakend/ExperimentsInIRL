# ExperimentsInIRL

We have several different IRL methods here:

apprenticeship learning via reinforcement learning (not very stable, but should reach an optimal policy after about 3000 iterations, but can diverge quickly, run_training_gans.py with the correct parameter)

behavioural cloning (run_bahavioural_cloning.py)

and a variety of GAIRL experimental combinations (run_training_gans.py)

The scripts have a helper file to help run them, but examples can be found in experiment_launcher.sh

----------------------------------

We use several resources to build up this code base and experiments. While we try to cite all our sources inline, we may have missed some. As such, we make a list here. There shouldn't be significant similarities to any of the repositories, but you may see bits and pieces taken. Thanks to the authors of those repositories for making our efforts easier in exploring IRL.
